# COS126_5_Linear_Feedback_Shift_Register
In this assignment, we create a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) data type to enable us to encrypt and decrypt image data.  An LFSR takes a seed string, and shifts its bits to the left sequentially by one digit, to result in a different set of bits. Repeating this in several steps allows us to encrypt the data present in individual pixels.
